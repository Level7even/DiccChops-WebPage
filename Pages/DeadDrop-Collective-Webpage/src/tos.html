        <div class="muted">Last updated: 2026</div>
        <section>
            <p>DeadDrop Collective is a player-run cooperative group. By interacting with us, requesting a session, or playing alongside our crews, you agree to the terms below.</p>
            <p><strong>If you don’t agree with these terms, don’t use the service.</strong></p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>1. What DeadDrop Collective Is</h2>
            <p>DeadDrop Collective provides cooperative, in-session gameplay assistance. We play alongside you during live sessions to help with coordination, scouting, escorting, and extraction support.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We are not a store.</li>
                <li>We do not sell items, loot, or in-game assets.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>2. What We Do Not Do</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not sell, trade, or deliver items</li>
                <li>We do not guarantee drops, progression, or success</li>
                <li>We do not promise outcomes of any kind</li>
                <li>We do not bypass game systems</li>
                <li>We do not use cheats, exploits, automation, or modified clients</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All gameplay is performed using standard, unmodified mechanics.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>3. How Sessions Work</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Engagements are session-based</li>
                <li>Support is provided during live gameplay only</li>
                <li>Difficulty, risk, and duration vary by zone and conditions</li>
                <li>Outcomes are determined by the game, not us</li>
                <li>Any items obtained during a session are acquired through normal gameplay by the player who loots them.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>4. Objective Persistence</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Some engagements involve continued support across multiple sessions.</li>
                <li>We commit to continued cooperative play, when agreed upon</li>
                <li>We do not guarantee completion, drops, or success</li>
                <li>Each session stands on its own</li>
                <li>Persistence refers to effort and participation — not control over results.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>5. Compensation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If compensation is involved, it reflects time, coordination, and operational risk</li>
                <li>It is not tied to items, rarity, or outcomes</li>
                <li>No refunds or extensions are based on loot or success</li>
                <li>We do not price or adjust engagements based on item names or drop rates.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
